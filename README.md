## This repo contains:
* This README
* A javascript-powered password generator page that uses user-selected criteria for what the passwords characters are
* Bootstrap 4 and my own stylesheet

## What I Learned:
* Bootstrap allows you to focus on the functionality of the page, rather than spending a lot of time just making the website look the way it needs to.
* Knowing Javascript and HOW to use it in it's full extent is extremely valuble and surface-level knowledge never holds up on more complex projects, such as this.

## Conclusion:
* I needs to study Javascript more so that I know how to use the built in features and methods so that I can confidently create powerful and dyamic webpages.
